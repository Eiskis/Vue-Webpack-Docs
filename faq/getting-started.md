# Getting started

**What practical steps should I take when starting a new project?**

1. Clone [`Eiskis/bellevue`](https://github.com/Eiskis/bellevue)
	- `git clone git@github.com:Eiskis/bellevue.git`
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Take a quick look at the [application structure diagram](../app/overview.md)?
4. Decide: do you want to use [Vuex](../app/vuex.md)?
	- You can use either services, Vuex or both to implement global state management
5. Draft the user-facing structure of your app by [adding pages and routes](../ui/routing.md)

You might want to remove the demo page, but you can also keep it around and maintain it as a component cheatsheet and test page for your project.
