# Getting started

**What practical steps should I take when starting a new project?**

1. Clone [`Eiskis/bellevue`](https://github.com/Eiskis/bellevue)
	- [SSH](git@github.com:Eiskis/bellevue.git)
	- [HTTPS](https://github.com/Eiskis/bellevue.git))
2. Take a quick look at the [application structure diagram](../app/overview.md)?
3. Decide: do you want to use [Vuex](../app/vuex.md)?
	- You can use either services, Vuex or both to implement global state management.
	- If you know Vuex is not for you, you can remove it easily.
	- Keeping Vuex code around won't hurt if you want to decide later.
4. [Add pages and routes](../ui/routing.md)
	- It's a good idea to draft the general user-facing structure of your app as soon as possible
