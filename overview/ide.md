# IDE integration

All pipeline configuration (linters etc.) can be consumed by plugins of any editor.

## Visual Studio Code

Workspace configuration is included in the project. The following extensions will make your life easier:

- `.ejs`
- `EditorConfig for VS Code`
- `ESLint`
- `stylelint`
- `TODO Highlight`
- `vetur`

VS Code will show linting issues inline while editing, and also as a list in the _problems_ toolbar.
