## Alternatives

How complex should we make global state management?

Vuex is very complex, but well integrated into Vue development tools, and uses some common patterns shared with other state management solutions.

There are [many authored alternatives](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue#state-management) out there. Simply writing custom services as viewless Vue objects can also work very nicely.
