# Vue Webpack

This is the documentation for [Eiskis/vue-webpack](https://github.com/Eiskis/vue-webpack). It's an advanced, opinionated Vue/Webpack project template for complex projects. It's based on the official [vuejs-templates/webpack](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) template.

**Note**: This is **not** an official Vue project.

## Requirements

Node. The preferred version of Node is configured in `.nvmrc`, so it's a good idea to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and `nvm use`.

For more info, see the [README in the actual project](https://github.com/Eiskis/vue-webpack).
