# App icons

```
└── static/
	├── favicon.png
	└── icon-48.png
```

App icons should be placed under `static/`. App icons are used by various browsers and operating systems in different ways, so you should make sure you have at least `favicon.png` available there. Furthermore it's a good idea to include some icons for your [web app manifest](../tooling/meta.md).
