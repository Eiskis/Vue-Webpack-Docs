# Server-side rendering

Server-side rendering is **not** preconfigured.

Bellevue is well equipped for you to integrate SSR in a way that best suits your need, in case you need it. For advanced needs however, it might be a better idea to get started with [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/). To find out more about enabling SSR in a Vue app app, check out this official guide at [ssr.vuejs.org](https://ssr.vuejs.org/en/).

Also keep in mind that some hosting providers offer prerendering as a service for single-page apps. See [Netlify's documentation](https://www.netlify.com/docs/prerendering/) as an example.
